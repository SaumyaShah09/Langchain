# LangChain Projects Repository

## What is LangChain?

[LangChain](https://langchain.com/) is a powerful framework for building applications powered by large language models (LLMs). It helps you combine LLMs with external tools, vector databases, document loaders, and chains of logic â€” making it easier to build advanced NLP workflows, chatbots, semantic search, and AI assistants.

Welcome to this collection of **LangChain-powered notebooks**, showcasing a variety of real-world NLP and AI tasks implemented with LangChain and related tools.

Each notebook is a standalone project demonstrating different capabilities such as semantic search, text chunking, skill extraction, multi-tool agent integration, and more.
